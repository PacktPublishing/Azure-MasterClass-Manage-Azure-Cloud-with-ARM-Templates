11.	Identify the incorrect information out of below mentioned information.
a.	ContentVersion is used to specify the version of the template you are authoring.
b.	Parameters defined in your resource template needs to be entered prior to starting the deployment.
c.	The properties element is used to describe the resource specific properties and the valid values for this are dependent on the resource type.
d.	You can’t define the complex type values in variables.

Feedback:
Incorrect if (a) is chosen. This is correct information. ContentVersion is used to specify the version of the template you are authoring.
Incorrect if (b) is chosen. This is correct information. Parameters defined in your resource template needs to be entered prior to starting the deployment.
Incorrect if (c) is chosen. This is correct information. The properties element is used to describe the resource specific properties and the valid values for this are dependent on the resource type.

12.	Choose the incorrect statement/s about Parameters in ARM templates.
a.	Parameters are used to provide flexibility within the function.
b.	It is used to not hard code any values that are really user-specific.
c.	Parameters defined in your resource template need to be entered prior to starting the deployment.
d.	Parameters are used to draw a line between the free-form and known configurations.

Feedback:
Incorrect if (a) is chosen. This is correct information. Parameters are basically used to provide the flexibility within ARM templates, so that users can provide the values during the run time.
Incorrect if (b) is chosen. This is correct information. Yes parameters are used to avoid the hardcode values in ARM templates, also it gives more dynamic feature to ARM templates.
InCorrect if (c) is chosen. This is correct information. Actually parameters have to be defined before the deployment, if you don’t define the value for any parameter used in ARM template, it will throw an error during execution.
Correct if (d) is chosen. This is incorrect information. Yes we define the parameters so that we can define the boundaries in templates for configurations and free from fields.

13.	Choose the incorrect element which is not part of the Output component in ARM templates.
a.	Value
b.	Type
c.	Metadata
d.	OutputName

Feedback:
Incorrect if (a) is chosen. This is correct element. Value is used to get the actual value of the output which is received as part of template execution. It can be hostname, Machine IP etc.
Incorrect if (b) is chosen. This is correct element. Type is used to get the type of value which is received as part of output.
Correct if (c) is chosen. This is incorrect information. Metadata is not the part of output elements.
Incorrect if (d) is chosen. This is correct element. OutputName is the name of the output. It can be any name defined in Output. There can be multiple output names in an output section.

d.	Member resource templates such as VM creation template, VNet Creation template etc. These are reusable or custom script which can be used with multiple resource templates. 

Feedback:
Correct if (a) is chosen. This is incorrect practice.  This is actually main templates which are more to be used for getting the input parameters.
InCorrect if (b) is chosen. This is correct practice. Shared resource template is used to deploy all of the resources that are very mandatory for our environment deployment.
InCorrect if (c) is chosen. This is correct practice. Optional resource template is used to deploy those resources which are optional in nature 
Incorrect if (d) is chosen. This is correct practice. Member resource templates such as VM creation template, VNet Creation template etc. These are reusable or custom script which can be used with multiple resource templates

15.	Users can define configuration settings (properties) directly in the resource or populate them from parameters and/or variables.
a.	True
b.	False
Feedback:
Correct if (a) is chosen. This is correct. During the resource configurations, you can configure the settings to provide values either from a variable or from a parameters and you can also provide the values as hard coded, which certainly is not a good practice.
Incorrect if (b) is chosen. This is incorrect. As explain, ARM templates provides us the flexibility to provide values through Parameters/variables during ARM definitions.
